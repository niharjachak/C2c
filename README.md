About the Project
The Placement Prediction System is an innovative tool designed to streamline and enhance the campus placement process. Developed by a dedicated team as a capstone project, this system provides powerful features to assist students, placement officers, and educational institutions in navigating the complexities of campus recruitment.

Project Modules
1. Student Placement Insights
With Student Placement Insights, users can dive deep into the placement data through comprehensive visualizations. This module provides detailed insights into various trends, success rates, and other critical metrics, all presented through intuitive graphs and charts.


2. Campus Analyser
The Campus Analyser module allows users to upload an Excel sheet containing student data. Using advanced predictive algorithms, it forecasts the number of students likely to secure placements. This feature helps institutions gauge overall placement potential and strategize accordingly.


3. Student Placement Analyser
The Student Placement Analyser module focuses on individual student success. By parsing a student's resume, this tool predicts their likelihood of being placed. This personalized analysis helps students understand their standing and what improvements they may need to increase their chances of landing a job.

Technologies and Approach
User-Centric Design: Aiming for a seamless user experience, we designed an interface that is both functional and easy to navigate.
Data-Driven Insights: Powered by Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, our system delivers precise analysis and predictions based on real student data.
Backend Efficiency: The system's backend, built with Flask, ensures fast processing and response times, making the analysis and predictions both quick and reliable.
Collaboration and Development
Throughout the development of this project, our team focused on effective collaboration and timely delivery. By maintaining open communication and working closely together, we successfully brought this comprehensive placement prediction system to life.
